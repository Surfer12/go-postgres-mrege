# Multi-Language Database Connector Framework

A robust, high-performance database connector framework designed for seamless interoperability across Mojo, Java, Swift, and Go, with optimized support for PostgreSQL.

## Project Overview

This project aims to deliver a unified database connector API that functions consistently across four programming languages:

- **Mojo**: Serves as the high-performance core implementation
- **Java**: Ensures full compatibility and interoperability with Mojo, incorporating best practices such as using `PreparedStatement` for SQL injection prevention and efficient query execution
- **Swift**: Provides full interoperability with Mojo, leveraging Swift's strong typing and error handling for robust database operations
- **Go**: Offers efficient and concurrent database operations, utilizing Go's goroutines for performance optimization

Each language implementation is crafted to maintain memory safety while optimizing performance, utilizing a handle-based API approach rather than raw pointers. Additionally, PostgreSQL-specific best practices are integrated, such as using parameterized queries and connection pooling for enhanced performance and security.

## Key Features

- ✅ Maintains memory safety
- ✅ Facilitates cross-language interoperability
- ✅ Optimized for high performance
- ✅ Implements automatic resource management
- ✅ Maintains a consistent API across all supported languages
- ✅ Incorporates Java's `PreparedStatement` for SQL injection prevention
- ✅ Utilizes PostgreSQL-specific optimizations like parameterized queries and connection pooling
- ✅ Leverages Go's concurrency model for efficient database operations

## Architecture

The framework employs a multi-tiered architecture:
