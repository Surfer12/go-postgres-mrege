# Memory Safety Guide

This guide explains the memory safety approach used in the database connector framework and how to ensure your code remains memory-safe when using it.

## Common Memory Safety Issues in Database Connectors

Traditional database connectors often suffer from these memory-related issues:

1. **Memory Leaks**: Failure to free allocated resources
2. **Use-After-Free**: Using memory after it has been freed
3. **Double-Free**: Attempting to free memory multiple times
4. **Buffer Overflows**: Writing beyond array boundaries
5. **Null Pointer Dereferences**: Accessing memory through null pointers

## Our Safety-First Approach

The database connector framework uses several techniques to prevent these issues:

### 1. Handle-Based Design

Instead of exposing raw pointers, all resources are managed through opaque handles:

```mojo
# Safe - using handle
let conn_handle = interop.create_connection(conn_string)
let result_handle = interop.execute_query(conn_handle, sql)

# Unsafe - using raw pointers (NEVER DO THIS)
let conn_ptr = get_raw_connection_pointer() # DON'T DO THIS
```

Benefits:
- Prevents direct pointer manipulation
- Ensures resources can be tracked and managed
- Allows for reference counting and safe cleanup

### 2. RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)

All resources are tied to object lifecycles:

```mojo
# Mojo - automatic cleanup through ownership
var db = DBConnector("connection_string")
db.connect()
# db is automatically cleaned up when it goes out of scope
```

```java
// Java - try-with-resources
try (DatabaseConnector db = new DatabaseConnector("connection_string")) {
    db.connect();
    // db is automatically closed when the try block ends
}
```

```swift
// Swift - automatic memory management with ARC
func doWork() {
    let db = DatabaseConnector(connectionString: "connection_string")
    db.connect()
    // db is automatically cleaned up when it goes out of scope
}
```

### 3. Exception Safety

All operations maintain memory safety even when exceptions occur:

```mojo
fn process_data() raises:
    var db = DBConnector("connection_string")
    try:
        db.connect()
        let results = db.query("SELECT * FROM data")
        # Process results...
    except:
        # Even if an exception occurs, db will be properly cleaned up
        raise
```

### 4. Safe Helper Types

The framework provides safe container types for results:

```mojo
# Safe result handling
let results = db.query("SELECT * FROM users")
for i in range(results.get_row_count()):
    let name = results.get_value(i, 0)
    # No direct memory access, bounds are checked
```

## Rules for Maintaining Memory Safety

When using the framework, follow these rules:

1. ✅ **Always use the provided high-level APIs**
2. ✅ **Let automatic cleanup work** - don't manually manage resources
3. ✅ **Use structured error handling** with proper resource cleanup
4. ✅ **Use the Result type** for query results
5. ✅ **Check for empty/null values** before using them

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. ❌ **Direct pointer manipulation**: Never attempt to get or use raw pointers
2. ❌ **Manual resource cleanup**: Don't call low-level free functions
3. ❌ **Caching stale handles**: Don't store handles after their owners are gone
4. ❌ **Bypassing the API**: Don't try to directly access the database
5. ❌ **Ignoring exceptions**: Always handle errors and ensure cleanup

## Memory Safety in Cross-Language Calls

When working across language boundaries:

1. **Use the provided wrappers**: The Magic and Max libraries handle memory safety
2. **Don't pass raw pointers between languages**: Always use handles
3. **Be aware of ownership**: Clearly define which language owns each resource
4. **Clean up resources in the language that created them**

## Testing for Memory Safety

The framework includes tools to verify memory safety:

1. **Leak detection tests**: Run with `./tests/memory/leak_test.mojo`
2. **Use-after-free tests**: Run with `./tests/memory/uaf_test.mojo`
3. **Memory sanitizers**: Build with `./scripts/build.sh --sanitize`

## Example: Safe Resource Management

```mojo
fn safe_database_operation() raises:
    # Connection is automatically managed
    var db = DBConnector("postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb")
    db.connect()
    
    # Results are automatically managed
    let results = db.query("SELECT id, name FROM users")
    
    # Process results safely
    for i in range(results.get_row_count()):
        let id = results.get_value(i, 0)
        let name = results.get_value(i, 1)
        print("User: " + name + " (ID: " + id + ")")
    
    # No manual cleanup needed
    # All resources are freed automatically
```

By following these guidelines, you can ensure your database operations remain memory-safe across all supported languages.
