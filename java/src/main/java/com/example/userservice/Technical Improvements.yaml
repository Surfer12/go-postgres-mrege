  Prioritized Next Steps

  Based on the current state of the project, here
   are the most important next steps in order of 
  priority:

  1. Core Testing Infrastructure: Implement basic
   unit and integration tests for all components 
  to ensure stability during further development.
  2. Authentication & Authorization: Add security
   to the API gateway and internal service 
  communication.
  3. CI/CD Pipeline: Set up automated build, 
  test, and deployment workflows.
  4. API Documentation: Create OpenAPI 
  specifications for all REST endpoints.
  5. Monitoring & Observability: Implement 
  logging, metrics, and tracing for operational 
  visibility.
  6. Developer Setup Guide: Improve documentation
   for onboarding new developers.
  7. Performance Testing: Benchmark the system to
   identify bottlenecks.
  8. Caching Strategy: Implement caching for 
  frequently accessed data.
  9. Error Handling Standardization: Ensure 
  consistent error responses across all services.
  10. Graceful Degradation: Implement circuit 
  breakers and fallback mechanisms for service 
  failures.

  These steps would provide a solid foundation 
  for both technical improvement and team 
  scalability, allowing for more advanced 
  features to be added later with confidence.
